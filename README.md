Here, assume R is a constant value and it equals to 30 m/s. V is a constant value and it equals to 6.5×10-6 m3. Besides, we assume that Kt is also a constant value and it equals to 50,000 N/m
Following table shows the ranges of the 4 independent variables in above function. Table 1: Bounds for the optimization problem Parameters Lower Bound Upper Bound mu (Kg) 20 35 ms (Kg) 350 500 K (N/m) 50,000 80,000 C (Ns/m) 1,500 2,700
